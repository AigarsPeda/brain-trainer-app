Since app was prebuilded and this script changes the app.json file, you can't run the app with `expo start` command.
You need to run `expo prebuild` before running the app.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild
   ```

3. Start the app iOS

   ```bash
    npx expo run:ios
   ```

4. Start the app Android

   ```bash
    npx expo run:android
   ```
